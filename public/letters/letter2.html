  <p>To whom it may concern:</p>

  <p>We hope today finds you well.  We are writing once again to let you know that donor dissatisfaction continues over Vanderbilt Student Communications&#8217; (&#8220;VSC&#8221;) move to sell the radio broadcast license to Vanderibilt&#8217;s six-decades strong student and community radio station 91.1FM WRVU.  Despite continued news coverage; public, student, staff, alumni, and donor outcry against the sale of the WRVU license, VSC has ignored all external parties and continues along the path to eliminate WRVU as a presence on the radio dial.</p>

  <p>We notified you recently about our campaign to solicit pledges from Vanderbilt alumni and donors.  Pledgers are committing to withhold any and all financial support and contributions from Vanderbilt University unless and until VSC ceases its attempts to sell WRVU&#8217;s radio license.  Earlier in the week we let you read about some of our pledgers.  Of course, the campaign continues and we continue to be surprised at the number of alumni and donors stepping up to say &#8220;no more&#8221;.</p>

  <p>Here are just some of the new pledges to &#8220;donate $0.00&#8221; we&#8217;ve received:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Jim Ballowe of the class of 1990 pledged $0.00 for the next 20 years.</li>
  <li>Kathryn Rogers Purselle of the class of 1991 pledged $0.00 for the next 10 years.</li>
  <li>Brennan T. Price of the class of 1992 pledged $0.00 for the next 20 years.</li>
  <li>Jeremy Benjamin of the class of 1995 pledged $0.00 for the next 5 years, and added the comment: &#8220;My time at WRVU was the single best experience provided by Vanderbilt while I was there. I learned skills, developed a voice, made connections, and met friends through the station. Selling the broadcast license is a mistake! Don&#8217;t allow it to occur. There are a huge number of students eager to take advantage and benefit from this resource and a host of interested alumni ready to assist them and the development of WRVU. That is an opportunity not to be squandered.&#8221;</li>
  <li>Philip Branning of the class of 2003 pledged $0.00 for the next 5 years, and added the comment: &#8220;Keep 91.1 on!&#8221;</li>
  <li>Alex Russo of the class of 2004 pledged $0.00 for the next 5 years.</li>
  <li>Kelly Taylor of the class of 2007 pledged $0.00 for the next 10 years.</li>
  <li>Lisa Schmitt of the class of 2008 pledged $0.00 for the next 5 years.</li>
  <li>Grant England of the class of 2009 pledged $0.00 for the next 5 years, and added the comment: &#8220;WRVU was an integral part of my experience and education at Vanderbilt. Please do not take that from future students.&#8221;</li>
  <li>Rob Rickman, Jr. of the class of 2010 pledged $0.00 for the next 5 years.</li>
  <li>Molly Hall of the class of 2013 pledged $0.00 for the next 20 years, and added the comment: &#8220;Greed trumping education and advancement of the human spirit. Vanderbilt, I thought you were a different school.&#8221;</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Of course we continue to receive anonymous pledges from those who wish to act on their opposition to the WRVU sale but not broadcast their names to the world.  A sampling of recent anonymous pledgers includes:</p>

  <li>Anonymous of the class of 2004 pledged $0.00 for the next 5 years.</li>
  <li>Anonymous of the class of 2006 pledged $0.00 for the next 5 years, and added the comment: &#8220;While I am proud of my Commodore heritage, these kind of tactics blemish that pride.&#8221;</li>
