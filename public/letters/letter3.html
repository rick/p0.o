<p>To whom it may concern:</p>

<p>As you are by now well aware, Vanderbilt Student Communications (&#8220;VSC&#8221;) is moving to sell the radio broadcast license to Vanderbilt&#8217;s six-decades strong student and community radio station 91.1FM WRVU.  Despite continued news coverage; public, student, staff, alumni, and donor outcry against the sale of the WRVU license, VSC has ignored all external parties and continues along the path to eliminate WRVU as a presence on the radio dial.</p>

<p>Our &#8220;pledge nothing&#8221; campaign, where we solicit pledges from Vanderbilt alumni and donors to give $0.00 for the next few years, continues and is growing stronger.  Pledgers are committing to withhold any and all financial support and contributions from Vanderbilt University unless and until VSC ceases its attempts to sell WRVU&#8217;s radio license.</p>

<p>Some of our pledge highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lucius W. Carroll II of the class of 1963 pledged $0.00 for the next 5 years.</li>
<li>Beth Lane of the class of 1991 pledged $0.00 for the next 5 years.</li>
<li>Audrey Clarke of the class of 1994 pledged $0.00 for the next 1 years.</li>
<li>Jennifer Bennett of the class of 2008 pledged $0.00 for the next 5 years.
Sarah Passino of the class of 2010 pledged $0.00 for the next 5 years.</li>
<li>Joe Blum of the class of 2011 pledged $0.00 for the next 5 years.</li>
<li><p>David Godlove of the class of 2012 pledged $0.00 for the next 5 years.</p></li>
<li><p>Catherine McKinney of the class of 1934 pledged $0.00 for the next 5 years, and added the comment: &#8220;I have been listening to WRVU for eight years now. I can not believe they would even fathom taking it off the air, and believe that trying to get people to send in money is just a way for them to make money and then they will still sell it to gain even more money.&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>Ryan D. Barack of the class of 1995 pledged $0.00 for the next 5 years, and added the comment: &#8220;I will give nothing more to Vanderbilt as long as the future of WRVU is uncertain. My law school can use the money and they aren&#8217;t selling their radio station.&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>Emily OBrien of the class of 1997 pledged $0.00 for the next 20 years, and added the comment: &#8220;You can count on $1000 from me this year if you change your plans and commit to not selling WRVU. I will also pledge to become an annual donor. Please don&#8217;t sell WRVU!&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>Annie Weisner of the class of 2009 pledged $0.00 for the next 10 years, and added the comment: &#8220;WRVU was a critical part of my Vanderbilt experience. It&#8217;s time for Vanderbilt to stand up and protect one of its greatest assets instead of sitting idly by while VSC Media considers sacrificing the very thing that makes WRVU so valuable, so special, and so important to Vanderbilt students.&#8221;</p></li>
</ul>
