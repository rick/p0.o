  <p>To whom it may concern:</p>

  <p>As you are aware, the Pledge Nothing campaign to save WRVU FM&#8217;s radio broadcasting license continues.  We are working to keep WRVU on the air through the commitment of donors, students, faculty, staff, and parents to donate $0.00 until WRVU is guaranteed a future of radio broadcasting.</p>

  <p>This week we have been in contact with Robert Ackley, who is the newly hired General Manager of WRVU.  He approached us with a Pledge Nothing pledge, and we spoke with him directly on his reasons behind pledging.  He wanted his 8-year $0.00 pledge to be public, and he had this to say:</p>

  <p>&#8220;My name is Robert Ackley, and I am the newly hired General Manager of WRVU. Already, I feel that my time working for the station has provided me with the sort of real-world, practical experience that is unlike any I have yet acquired from my classes. As an Arts &amp; Science student, WRVU provides the next best thing after Blair for me to get into the music business. </p>

  <p>WRVU represents a valuable opportunity for learning which would hardly exist if it reverted solely to an online stream. I fear that if sold, many students would cease to be interested in participating in WRVU, just as many have quit already as a result of the VSC Board&#8217;s recent actions. As a non-profit that claims not to be facing any immediate financial danger, VSC ought not to sell off its largest asset at such a detriment to student learning when education should be its primary goal. </p>

  <p>It saddens me to see from Vanderbilt&#8217;s administration such little apparent interest in its students, particularly when we have already gathered nearly 2000 undergraduate student signatures in opposition to the sale. I urge the administration to take a stand on this issue, for otherwise, I pledge with these other supporters of WRVU not to donate to Vanderbilt for the next 8 years if WRVU&#8217;s broadcast license is sold.&#8221;</p>

  <p>People who know the value of WRVU radio continue to come forth to stand behind the station.</p>
