  <p>To those of you following the &#8220;Pledge Nothing&#8221; campaign to keep WRVU-FM on the radio dial, we have an important announcement:</p>

  <p id="scroll_to_here" >It has come to our attention that our statement that &#8220;Lucius W. Carroll II of the Class of 1963 has pledge $0.00 for the next 5 years&#8221; was completely incorrect.  We were contacted by Mr. Carroll today, who is a long-time supporter of Vanderbilt, and who made no such pledge.  We apologize to him and to you for any confusion or harm this may have caused.</p>

  <p>We apologize for this misrepresentation, which was unintentional, and resulted from our faith in members of the community to honorably represent themselves.  It appears we cannot rest on that trust alone.  We will continue to work to improve our pledge system to avoid these sorts of issues in the future.</p>

  <p>The Pledge Nothing campaign is a voluntary campaign to register the commitment of Vanderbilt donors to withhold donations until such time as WRVU radio is safe from attempts to sell its broadcast license.  The power in the campaign comes directly from pledgers who actually follow through on their pledges, not merely from those people who announce that they have pledged.</p>

  <p>Sincerely,</p>
  <p>Rick Bradley -- Organizer, Pledge Nothing</p>
