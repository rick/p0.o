<div class="letter">
  <p>To those of you following the &#8220;Pledge Nothing&#8221; campaign to keep
  WRVU-FM on the radio dial, we have an important announcement:</p>

  <p>It has come to our attention that our statement that &#8220;Lucius W.
  Carroll II of the Class of 1963 has pledge $0.00 for the next 5 years&#8221;
  was completely incorrect.  We were contacted by Mr. Carroll today, who
  is a long-time supporter of Vanderbilt, and who made no such pledge.</p>

  <p>We apologize to Mr. Carroll and to you for any confusion or harm this
  may have caused.</p>

  <p>The misrepresentation was unintentional, resulting from our faith in
  members of the community at large to honorably represent themselves.
  It appears, for reasons unclear to us, that we cannot rest on that
  trust alone.  We have taken steps to anonymize all unreported and
  future pledges so that temptations are reduced in the future.</p>

  <p>The Pledge Nothing campaign is a voluntary campaign to register the
  commitment of Vanderbilt donors to withhold donations until such time
  as WRVU radio is safe from attempts to sell its broadcast license.
  The power in the campaign comes directly from pledgers who actually
  follow through on their pledges, not merely from those people who
  announce that they have pledged.  We encourage &#8220;Pledge Nothing&#8221;
  members to donate with fervor once Vanderbilt has moved to protect
  WRVU, a great educational and community asset.</p>

  <p>We will continue to work to improve our pledge system so that we act
  as a better mirror of community sentiment.</p>

  <p>Sincerely,</p>
  <p>Rick Bradley -- Organizer, Pledge Nothing</p>
