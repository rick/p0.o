<p>To whom it may concern:</p>

<p>As you are likely well aware, Vanderbilt Student Communications
("VSC") is moving to sell the radio broadcast license to Vanderibilt's
six-decades strong student and community radio station 91.1FM WRVU.
Despite continued news coverage; public, student, staff, alumni, and
donor outcry against the sale of the WRVU license, VSC has ignored all
external parties and continues along the path to eliminate WRVU as a
presence on the radio dial.</p>

<p>Recently we have begun to solicit pledges from Vanderbilt alumni and
donors.  Pledgers are committing to withhold any and all financial
support and contributions from Vanderbilt University unless and until
VSC ceases its attempts to sell WRVU's radio license.  As of today we
have received 515 years' worth of "pledge nothing" support.</p>

<p>Some of our recent pledge highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>David Barie of the class of 1981 pledged $0.00 for the next 5 years.</li>
<li>Pete Wilson of the class of 1984 pledged $0.00 for the next 10 years.</li>
<li>Ingrid Regen of the class of 1990 pledged $0.00 for the next 5 years.</li>
<li>Heather R. Perry of the class of 1992 pledged $0.00 for the next 5
years, and added the comment: "As a college professor, I can attest
that getting rid of this student resource is the worst idea I've heard
in years. This decision effectively cuts down on the opportunities
that young adults have to "apprentice" in media and to hone their
communication skills -- skills which are desperately needed in today's
job market. A truly terrible decision. My donations go to McGill Hall
and WRVU -- you have effectively removed reason for me to want to
support this university."</li>
<li>Rick Bradley of the class of 1994 pledged $0.00 for the next 5 years.</li>
<li>Sharon M. Scott of the class of 1996 pledged $0.00 for the next 20
years, and added the comment: "with a change in VSC administration, I
would pledge a SIGNIFICANT amount to VU every year for the rest of my
life. Otherwise, I will give nothing!"</li>
<li>Myka Carroll of the class of 1997 pledged $0.00 for the next 5 years.</li>
<li>Mitch Porcello of the class of 1998 pledged $0.00 for the next 5
years, and added the comment: "If you sell off my favorite experience
as a student, you won't get my money."</li>
<li>Angie Jackson of the class of 2002 pledged $0.00 for the next 5 years.</li>
<li>James Hall of the class of 2004 pledged $0.00 for the next 1 years,
and added the comment: "As a past guest dj on the air, I am appalled
by this!"</li>
<li>Anthony DelPiano of the class of 2007 pledged $0.00 for the next 20
years, and added the comment: "If Vanderbilt allows the shutdown of
WRVU, I will never donate a penny to the school as long as I live. I
have always planned on giving back annually, but if the license is
sold, I hope the proceeds are dwarfed by the loss in funds from former
DJs and other WRVU supporters. Please don't let this sale happen."</li>
<li>Amanda Hagood of the class of 2011 pledged $0.00 for the next 5 years.</li>
<li>Kathryn Fischer of the class of 2013 pledged $0.00 for the next 8 years.</li>
</ul>


<p>The ability to "pledge nothing" anonymously has also been popular, for
those who wish to act on their opposition to the WRVU sale but not
broadcast their names to the world.  A sampling of anonymous pledgers
includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Anonymous of the class of 1980 pledged $0.00 for the next 20 years,
and added the comment: "Till I know the future of Wrvu is secure !"</li>
<li>Anonymous of the class of 1985 pledged $0.00 for the next 5 years.</li>
<li>Anonymous of the class of 1986 pledged $0.00 for the next 5 years.</li>
<li>Anonymous of the class of 1989 pledged $0.00 for the next 5 years.</li>
<li>Anonymous of the class of 1997 pledged $0.00 for the next 5 years.</li>
<li>Anonymous of the class of 2006 pledged $0.00 for the next 5 years.</li>
<li>Anonymous of the class of 2006 pledged $0.00 for the next 5 years.</li>
<li>Anonymous of the class of 2009 pledged $0.00 for the next 15 years.</li>
<li>Anonymous of the class of 2011 pledged $0.00 for the next 5 years.</li>
<li>Anonymous parents of the class of 1996 pledged $0.00 for the next 5
years, and added the comment: "after all, we put a lot of money into
the school and our kids education. Put 1996 because that is the year
my daughter graduated. "</li>
</ul>


<p>And even current students are making pledges, to go into effect upon
their graduation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Anonymous of the class of 2013 pledged $0.00 for the next 5 years,
and added the comment: "A college without a real radio station is not
a real college. "</li>
<li>Anonymous of the class of 2013 pledged $0.00 for the next 5 years.</li>
<li>Anonymous donor pledged $0.00 for the next 5 years, and added the
comment: "I am not personally a graduate of Vanderbilt University,
however I have donated time, resources, and participated in events
benefiting WRVU over the past 10 years. I hereby pledge that I will
not patronize anything associated with Vanderbilt University, i.e. its
hospitals and medical practices, and all athletic events, if WRVU's
broadcast license is sold. "</li>
</ul>


<p>Pledgers are sending letters, making phone calls, and agreeing to
"pledge nothing" when Vanderbilt Fund solicitors call.  Pledge Nothing
is happy to record a record of those willing to sign up on our site,
but we expect the long term impact of our campaign to grow so long as
WRVU is threatened.</p>
